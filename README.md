# Flappy Learn
Flappy Learn is a piece of software which tries to be a practical example of Machine Learning.

The goal of this project is being able to play to an online version of the popular game ‘Flappy Bird’. It will start taking random decisions, however it will learn about their results and it will choose the most appropriate action in each case. For achieving that, a complete mathematical model about our problem was developed.

This project was originally developed by [Álvaro Reneses](http://alvaroreneses.com/) for his Intelligent Systems course's final project, within one week. Due to this time limitations, its working is not optimal.
